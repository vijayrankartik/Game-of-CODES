A tool of programmers, by programmers and for programmers.
<br>
<br>

**Game of Codes** is a tool for codeforces lovers who want to practice optimally in a gaming mood. What you have to do is to make an account either by registering via email or by google and give your codeforces handle.

<br>

## FEATURES IT PROVIDE


* **DASHBOARD** contains boxes having links to weak and strong topics, questions to be upsolved, and unsolved mysteries. Generate daily mix gives you a personalised contest based on your weak and strong topics. We have distributed questions in sets which are basically a set of questions. The difficulty of the questions rises as you unlock higher sets. The red bar on the right is a track of your daily record which is by default 16000.
* **COMPARE** : You can compare different profiles in the compare tab by just entering the handle name of the user you want to compare with.

* **PROFILE** gives you your stats(submissions, results, all those graphs).
* **CodeBlast** is a platform for a team fight(max members are 3). Basically these members will be given some set of 3 questions and they will be ranked according to the number of solved questions.

* **TRAINING ZONES** 
  * **Level wise**: It will train you on the basis of codeforces rating and give you questions in that particular range and a timer of 2 hours.
  * **Topic wise**: It will train you in a particular topic by giving you sets with progressively higher difficulty.
* **Vizualisers**
  * **Sorting Visualizers**: These help users to understand various sorting visualisers which are built to learn and have fun simultaneously.
  * **Path Finding Visualizers**: These visualisers give users a deep insight to the various path finding algorithms in a very fun way.
